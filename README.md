solaris-chromium-patches
========================

A set of patches to apply to chromium, to (some day) get it to compile under Solaris 11

Based on a conversation at
https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-dev/i0HihMMitkw
I cannot simply fork the entire chromium tree onto github. So, I'm somewhat copying the style of 
https://github.com/gliaskos/freebsd-chromium
to use this as a public repository of patches for chromium on solaris
